An XNA library providing constructive solid geometry operations

**Abandonware!**

This project is *long* since dead. This is purely for reference/posterity!

The current state of the code is a fairly ok [Half Edge geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list) system. This was intended to be the basis for constructive solid geometry but it never got that far.
